When working with sources, it is imperative to know the age of the source

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
- therefore, it is important to investigate whether the source you are using is current enough for your purpose.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Is the knowledge you need from the source still up-to-date -

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
- or does more suitable knowledge exist?

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
If you are for instance researching something about sustainable companies -

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
- this article from the American magazine Forbes has a lot of interesting angles and pieces of information.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
But remember to check the date!

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
The article is from 2010 -

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
- and because the development is very fast within the field, it is crucial that you use the most recent sources.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Some areas, like for instance sustainability or social media are in constant development - 

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
- therefore articles within these fields are quickly outdated

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
Other areas are less variable - therefore a source can be up-to-date although it is not brand new.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
For instance some standards within the building industry are still up-to-date even though they are several years old.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
There is also a lot of scientific research that is still current, although it is not from recent years.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
In most cases, it is important that you use the most current knowledge within your field -

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
- but being up-to-date does not only refer to the source being brand new -

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
- but also that it is the right source for your project!
