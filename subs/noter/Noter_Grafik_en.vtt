00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.830
When you take notes, it can be a good
 idea to use words and drawings 

2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.620
in combination, as it activates 
both hemispheres simultaneously. 

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.480
Often, you will primary use your 
left hemisphere when studying, 

4
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.050
but if you enrichen your textual notes with
a visual element your brain will think 

5
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.110
more holistically and increase your 
understanding of complex topics. 

6
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.320
Just like a picture says more than a thousand word.

7
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.950
There are many different techniques to 
taking visual notes but common for all

8
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.970
is that you needn’t be an artist 
to add a visual spice to your notes.

9
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.220
To illustrate a process or get an 
overview of a circle of events, 

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.220
you can use a simple timeline.

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.270
It could be a company’s development with important 

12
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.500
events as markers.

13
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.720
A tree diagram is an excellent choice to 
illustrate hierarchical relationships as in 

14
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.860
an organisation or a process with various branches.
A mind-map is excellent to 

15
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.700
illustrate how a topic relates to sub- 
and key topics, and could as an example

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.830
depict a concept, a person or a brand.

17
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.120
Sketchnotes is a newer trend.

18
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.530
The internet is full of impressive examples, but 

19
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.430
it needn’t be so advanced.

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.780

21
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.890
Basically, you can create your own 
system from a small set of principles.

22
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.050
Besides the benefits of holistic thinking it can also 

23
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.990
give you a better overview and save time.

24
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.530
An example could be something important, 
something very important, your own idea, 

25
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.930
a reference from a teacher, something 
difficult you need to check up on, 

26
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.510
something you need to look further into 
or something completely different.

27
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.510


28
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.950
Use it as a method to get a better overview 

29
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.900
and personalise your system.
