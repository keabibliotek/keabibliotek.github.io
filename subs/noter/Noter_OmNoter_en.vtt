00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.670
Taking notes helps you store knowledge.

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.210
It’s not just about having something 
to pull out from the drawer 

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.290
before the exam.

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.790
It also helps you retain what 
you learn in class or read. 

5
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.660
There are plenty of reasons for 
looking through your notes occasionally.

6
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.660
This graph shows how the amount of 
remembered subject matter recede over time. 

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.340
The curve is of course indicative, but none the 
less it gives a general idea of how much

8
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.320
you can improve your memory by frequently 
skimming your notes. After 10 minutes 

9
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.020
you start forgetting what you’ve 
read or learned in class 

10
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.770
and if you don’t recap, most of it will be forgotten

11
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.920
within a month.

12
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.200
Hvis man derimod sørger for at kigge sine
noter igennem efter kort tid kan man

13
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.600
On the other hand, if you run through your notes within 
a short amount of time you will most likely remember more.  

14
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.940
It demands a small effort,

15
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.290
but there is a lot to gain.

16
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.090
If you recap the subject using your notes 
just once, it’s more likely to stick.

17
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.280
Effekten fortsætter ved efterfølgende gentagelser og
som man kan se på grafen har

18
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.740
The effect continues by repetition and, as the 
graph shows, also strengthens retention in the long run.

19
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.990
If you frequently run through your notes, you 
can drastically improve your learning outcome, 

20
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.260
while avoiding the feeling of 
having wasted your time in class.

21
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.320
But there’s even more benefits of taking notes.

22
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.330
It keeps you concentrated and helps you stay 
focused on the subject matter, 

23
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.160
thus preventing your mind from wandering.

24
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.830
Desuden fremmer det din bearbejdning, selektion
og overblik at tage noter.

25
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.560
Note taking also strengthens your comprehension, selection 
and overview and enables you to better understand what you hear or read, 

26
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.150
because you simultaneously process and emphasise key points.
