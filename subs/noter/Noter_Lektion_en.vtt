00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.740
If you want to get the most out of your lectures

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.310
it is important to take good notes.

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.240
It will always pay off to take notes during class,

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.540
even if your teacher shares the slides 
with you or use the black board.

5
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.400
Research proves that taking notes 
increases your learning as you process

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.820
the subject matter more thoroughly 
when you write notes. 

7
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.200
You can say that notes relieve your memory so 
you can spend more energy on understanding.

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.150
When you take notes, you activate your 
prior subject knowledge and 

9
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.440
process the topic while writing,

10
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.950
which enhances both learning and understanding.

11
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.720
Simultaneously, you structured your knowledge 
while writing and can therefore use the notes 

12
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.840
later on in exam preparation or written assignments.

13
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.240
There are several note taking methods and it is important to choose one that is right for you.

14
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.240


15
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.620
Some note down most of what the teacher says, and others

16
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.000
simply note down keywords.

17
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.570
A good strategy is often to go for 
quality rather than quantity.

18
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.300
Donâ€™t just write everything but

19
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.360
consider what might be important for 
you to know in your specific profession.

20
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.320
This keeps you active and enables you to 
process what you learn more efficiently.

21
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.480
If you just passively write down everything 
without any selection, this will diminish your learning outcome.

22
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.480


23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.860
In order to be an active note taker, 
multitasking is an important skill.

24
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.380
You need to note while 
listening to the teachers.

25
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.560
This can be difficult at first, but with 
a little practice you will get the hang of it.

26
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.370
It is therefore important to prepare for class.

27
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.890
The more you know about the topic in advance, 
the better your notes and ability

28
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.950
to multitask will be.

29
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.700
When you write notes make sure 
to use your own words.

30
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.150
This way you make knowledge your own and 
you will better remember and relate to  

31
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.660
the subject matter.

32
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.040
It is of course important to note key 
subject terms accurate.

33
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.390
Use abbreviations to save time and 
get a better overview.

34
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.530
Finally, itâ€™s up to you if you prefer 
writing by hand or using a computer.

35
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.940
If you use a computer be careful not just 
to write down everything 

36
00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.900
the teacher says.

37
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.130
When you write on a computer you might tend to do so,

38
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.290
as most people write faster on a computer than by hand.

39
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.770
Computers can also be distracting and cause you to procrastinate

40
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.420
because of social media, games and the like.

41
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.740
Remember, practice makes perfect, but most importantly: 
choose the note taking technique  

42
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.220
that suits you.
