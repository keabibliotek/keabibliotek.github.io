00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.920
There are many different methods for taking notes, 

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.060
which generally falls within two categories: 
hand written and digital.

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.350
One obvious benefit of taking notes on paper 
is that you can express 

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.730
yourself more freely and less constrained 
than with digital notes.

5
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.540
This is particularly relevant if you are a visual 
learner who draws illustrations and models.

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.420
If you write notes by hand it can be a good idea 
to organise the paper for at better overview. 

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.420


8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.670
There are plenty of methods for doing so,

9
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.060
for example the Cornell method, but the name isn’t 
important as long as you have a system.

10
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.860
Write key terms in the margin and indent the notes to

11
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.790
easily find the key points.

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.350
Create your own note taking language with 
abbreviations and use a system of icons 

13
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.250
for a quick overview.

14
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.880
If you take notes by hand it is recommended to 
have a system for organising the notes.

15
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.420
Mark for example the header with course, topic and date.

16
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.410
Hand writing notes can be a great choice 
if you are easily distracted by 

17
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.030
social media, games and the like.

18
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.750
Some research even indicate that you remember the 
subject matter better if you write by hand.

19
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.880
But it can be hard to organise your paper notes

20
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.540
and they can be difficult to edit and search for.

21
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.340
Fortunately, a lot of programs let you combine 
hand writing with digital. 

22
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.340


23
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.810
There are many options which varies from simple text editing 

24
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.430
to dedicated note taking programs.

25
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.310
Use one platform for everything that makes 

26
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.960
it easier to organise and search.
If you use a cloud service, 

27
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.260
you can take notes on whatever is available 
– laptop, tablet, phone, etc.

28
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.440
Some programs can scan hand writing to digital letters.

29
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.440


30
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.480
When you work digitally, it is easy to organise notes 
into categories and color-codes, 

31
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.220
plus it makes searching easier.

32
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.170
Furthermore, you can save powerpoints, images, 
videos, etc directly 

33
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.740
in your notes.

34
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.210
So, it doesn’t have to be either/or, but no matter 
what strategy you choose, it can be

35
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.910
a good idea to look through them occasionally, 
as it helps you retrieve and 

36
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.410
understand the subject matter better.

37
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.590
Most importantly: find the method that works for you!

38
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.000
If you can’t use everything, consider trying out different 
techniques and customising them

39
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.660
to fit your own note system.
