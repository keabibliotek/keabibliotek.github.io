00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.270
Well-made reading notes will keep you from 
having to read the same text twice, 

2
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.630
as you already have highlighted important 
passages and noted key points the first time.

3
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.370
While taking notes you reflect upon 
what you’ve read, which improves 

4
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.410
understanding and engages your 
prior knowledge of the subject.

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.940
Simply put; you can write notes in the margin 

6
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.200
–if it’s your own copy, of course.

7
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.920
Note what the passage is about

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.920


9
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.370
and if you have further questions you need 
to check up on or ask your 

10
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.030
teacher about.

11
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.980
You can also highlight important words or sentences.

12
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.990
This enables you to quickly find relevant 

13
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.090
passages or topics later on.

14
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.610
Be careful not to highlight too much. 

15
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.000
As a rule of thumb, you should only mark what is essential: 

16
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.840
key terms, concepts, definitions and conclusions.

17
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.930
Remember: Quality rather that quantity.

18
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.160
A little goes a long way.

19
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.900
If you want to advance your reading notes system, 

20
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.950
you can use color-coding or post-its to indicate 

21
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.160
essential pages or chapters.

22
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.430
Finally, you can decide to write a short resumé. 

23
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.680
But of course, that depends on your purpose with reading the text. 

24
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.570
It might not be necessary.
