WEBVTT - Kildekritik motiv

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
There can be many different intentions behind a source.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
Therefore, it is important to keep a critical mindset, in order to better decode the motive of the source.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
Start by asking yourself why the source is written, who it is written for, and what the purpose of the source is?

00:16.000 --> 00:23.000
Is the source written with the purpose of informing or does it try to sell something, like a politicial agenda or a commercial product?

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
If you are searching for information about solar panels for instance, this homepage could be quite useful - 

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
- but at the same time it is obvious, that the main purpose is to sell a product!
 
00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Regardless whether the information is sound or not, it can be problematic to use sources that have clear commercial interests - 

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
- instead it can be a good idea to get information about the solar panels from an official source like the Danish Energy Agency -

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
- who works independently from commercial and political interests.
