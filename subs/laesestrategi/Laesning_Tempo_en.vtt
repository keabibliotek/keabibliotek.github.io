Many environmental, physical and mental factors 
can affect the speed of your reading. 

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.540
In this video, you will be introduced to two 
simple techniques for improving it.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.510
But be aware that many other factors such as lightning, 
sound, vocabular and mental awareness 

4
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.980
also has an impact on your reading speed, as 
well as an internal read-along voice can

5
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.240
slow down reading drastically. 
In order to exercise speed reading you should work with fixations 

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.470
and forward reading.

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.970
When you read, your eyes don’t move in one fluid motion. 
They jump through the text 

8
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.720
and read the words in fixations. 

9
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.090
When we learn how to read, we start letter by 
letter and move on to word by word.

10
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.660
But by widening your gaze and taking in more words at 
the same time, it is possible to read with 

11
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.920
fewer fixations per line.Thus, you improve your reading 
speed by generally increasing the speed and 

12
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.980
forcing yourself to frequent line shifts.

13
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.650
Many have the habit of jumping back in the text 
while reading – so called regression.

14
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.450
The trick is to trust your brain and assure 
yourself that you have caught the key points.

15
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.900
You can use a couple of simple methods to train forward reading.

16
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.310
For example, you can use a piece of paper and let it slide down 

17
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.360
the page in a proper tempo.

18
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.000
This way you restrain the eyes 
from jumping back in the text. 

19
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.410
Another method involves a pen which defines the reading speed.

20
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.740
Your eyes will naturally follow the motion of the pen.

21
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.760
The intent is to let the eye follow the pen, not the other way around.

22
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.840
Consider your reading tempo, especially if you feel

23
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.680
like a slow reader.

24
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.190
If you read too slow it can influence your comprehension as you might

25
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.910
lose overview.

26
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.850
On the other hand: if you read too fast you might not understand

27
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.570
what you’ve read.

28
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.360
You can measure your reading tempo with this simple formula

29
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.500
The average reader reads somewhere between 2-400 words pr. minute

30
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.250
if the text is not too difficult.

31
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.540
The absolute max reading speed with comprehension is about 800 words/min 

32
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.230
for the skilled reader with a lot of pre-knowledge.

33
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.880


34
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.690


35
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.500
Speed reading is not a quick fix. To improve your reading tempo, 

36
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.720
everyday training is important.

37
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.260
Remember that not all texts are fit for speed reading and that 

38
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.950
it can help to exercise speed reading in intervals with easy-to-read texts.
