Applying good pre-reading strategies and choosing 
the right reading methods is important, 

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.150
especially when you read more advanced texts.
But using post-reading strategies 

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.010
is no bad idea either!

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.100
When you've read your text, ask yourself 

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.160
if you learnt what you'd expected.

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.150
A couple of reflective minutes is well spent.
Ask yourself 

7
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.790
if you've understood the general idea and central concepts  

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.060
or if anything needs further attention.
Maybe you need to re-read the text or ask your

9
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.690
teacher to explain it.

10
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.010
One strategy for post-reading is to sum up the central points

11
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.910
- take notes while reading, write a resumÃ©, draw a mind map or 

12
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.640
explain what you've read for a fellow student or family member.

13
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.470
It doesn't need to take long,

14
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.360
just a couple of minutes

15
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.500
- research has shown that even a short recap improves 

16
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.450
both learning outcome and retention.

17
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.410
You will notice when you recap the text if your 
understanding of the text is insufficient. 

18
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.580
Note down what you don't understand and seek answers

19
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.670
from your teacher, study group or someone else.
