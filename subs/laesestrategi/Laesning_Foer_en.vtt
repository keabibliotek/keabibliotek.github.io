Our main tip on how to improve your study preparation 
time is to use pre-reading techniques.

2
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.570
Before you start reading a text, it is essential 
that you complete a thorough pre-reading.

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.340
You pre-read in order to get an overall view: 
What is the topic of the text?

4
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.810
How is it constructed? How difficult is it to read?

5
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.160
And last, but not least, what will you use it for? 
What is YOUR intention with reading the text?

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.120
Maybe your teacher has emphasised topics or 
concepts you need to pay special attention to. 

7
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.120


8
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.400
Never start reading a text from page 1 and onwards, 
before youâ€™ve done a pre-reading. 

9
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.010
If you start reading a text without a clearly stated purpose,

10
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.880
you can easily end up reading without

11
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.370
direction and lose track of the intention.

12
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.040
When you do a pre-reading, you check out 
the frontpage, the back page,

13
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.930
table of contents, illustrations, headlines, 
graphics, illustrations, etc.

14
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.160
This will give you a general overview and 
activate your prior subject knowledge

15
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.750
and most likely help you to better comprehend 
and remember the text.

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.750
