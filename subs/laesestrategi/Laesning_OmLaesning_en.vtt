00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.190
Most students will notice the big change from being a 

2
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.220
pupil at a secondary school to student 
at a higher education institution.

3
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.180
One important difference is, that you are 
now more responsible for your own 

4
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.750
learning outcomes. 

5
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.410
The teachers’ role at a higher education 
institution is e.g. more professional than 

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.730
pedagogical. Which means that your teacher won’t guide you 

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.110
through the curriculum and make sure everyone 
is following along, so you must 

8
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.110


9
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.290
pay special attention.

10
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.860
Furthermore, it is undeniably time 
consuming to study at a higher education. 

11
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.130
The amount of reading material can at 
times seem daunting and scary

12
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.680
– especially if you don’t feel 
you’re the fastest reader.

13
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.880
Therefore, it is important to learn   

14
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.550
how to study smarter,

15
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.460
because there is a lot to gain from choosing 
the right approach to and techniques for your studies.

16
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.570
And this is not just about scheduling your reading and finding a good  

17
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.350
physical study environment.

18
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.600
It is also about actively prioritising and evaluating your reading.

19
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.810
If you can’t decipher how to read a curriculum 
book, you can easily be overwhelmed by the 

20
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.270
volume of reading material. This, in turn, can 
make you feel like an insufficient student, 

21
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.870
which is a pity because learning how to 
optimise your reading isn’t hard.

22
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.520
We will here present you with techniques and strategies  

23
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.040
to help you get the most out of your reading.

24
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.800
Basically, you must approach your reading process 
in three stages: before, during and after.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.800
