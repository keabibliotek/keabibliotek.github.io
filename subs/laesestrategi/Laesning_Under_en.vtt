00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.200
In a perfect world, after you’ve done a pre-reading, 
you will know your purpose with the text and decide 

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.200


3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.040
on the most appropriate reading technique.
Should you read it normally, thoroughly or

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.890
perhaps just skim it?

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.810
Skimming is a reading strategy that 
can come in handy when you study. 

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.280
Even though many see it as cheating it is quite a handy strategy 

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.490
– especially if you feel overwhelmed by 
the number of texts you need to read.

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.610
Skimming is the obvious choice for gaining a broad overview on large topics 

9
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.020
or if you are looking for a specific piece of information.
To skim a text, simply let your eyes move

10
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.700
through the lines of text without reading every word.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.490
Focus instead on the more essential parts such as 

12
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.830
headlines, sub-headlines, captions, illustrations, graphs, etc 

13
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.020
or a specific keyword if you seek specific information.

14
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.430
A hint is to focus on the introduction and conclusion of the chapter.

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.400
This will often give you a general idea of the text’s 
essence and most important points.

16
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.810
Finally, it’s worth mentioning that skimming also can 
come in handy in emergency situations when

17
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.610
you don’t have time to prepare thoroughly for class.

18
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.290
A quick skimming of even difficult texts can often 
provide you with a basic understanding, 

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.540
so you won’t be completely lost when your teacher 
goes through the subject matter.
