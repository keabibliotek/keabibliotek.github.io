00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.710
I think it has a lot to do with self-discipline

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.260
and not having things open or 
close enough to divert your attention.

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.260


4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.230
Sometimes, it can be helpful to
move to a spot with

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.880
less visual noise.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.940
Don't keep your phone close -
put it away.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.690
You don't need it.

8
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.860
Moving yourself to another location and only 
concentrating on the task at hand

9
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.130,
it simply increases your focus.

10
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.820
Dedicate time and make sure 
there are no disturbing elements.

11
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.560
Coffee - lots of coffee.

12
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.190
Asking for help when you need it is not 
always easy, especially if you almost have it

13
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.910
but just don't have the time.

14
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.060There's a tip from the military 
called embrace the suck.

15
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.200
This is gonna suck.

16
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.380
It is gonna be insanely hard.

17
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.700
And it is going to take a long time.

18
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.570
And it is not going to 
be fun along the way.

19
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.970
But when you are done, it is 
going to be really nice.

20
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.240
So it is going to suck, but embrace it.

21
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.800
I move focus and tap 
into the dishwasher effect.

22
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.850
I go to descale the coffee maker, 
then I get a new perspective.

23
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.190
Just write things down. If it was in 
your calendar you wouldn't be in doubt.

24
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.390
I use a calendar to
write down meetings

25
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.660
so I'll get a reminder before.

26
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.160
I make a lot of checklists. I put a check mark 
when it is done and a minus when

27
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.440
it is almost there.

28
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.250
I use a disposition as a form of 
checklist so I do not forget ideas.

29
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.250

30
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.210
The first thing I do each day
is to check my calendar.

31
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.230
What appointments do I have today?

32
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:38.500
I check the notes for the day in my notebook 
and at the same time I ask my colleagues

33
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.620
if they have something else 
that needs to be prioritized.

34
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.470
At the end of the day, I go through 
the day and think about what is on

35
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.860
for tomorrow.

36
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.590
When you come in the next day, 
you already know what to do.

37
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.700
You have already thought it through once.

38
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.420
You may not remember your thoughts exactly, 
but you have been through the

39
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.750
thought process, so it is in the back of your 
mind even if you go home and relax.
