00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.980
It takes a lot of time to get to know a company and 
your co-workers so you actually understand

2
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.090
what they mean.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.270
The biggest challenge I can see 
is by far communication.

4
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.610
There are some communicative 
difficulties between people.

5
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.360
You have to be aware of 
which messages you send

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.630
but also how you choose to 
interpret what you receive.

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.080
In the real world, 
it is really about people skills.

8
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.280
You need to be able to understand 
the customer in front of you and

9
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.690
establish a quick relation.

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.640
That is just an essential skill.

11
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.780
Listen to the others and try to understand 
what they are actually saying.

12
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.780


13
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.700
Don't hesitate to push your own opinions, but observe 

14
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.670
what is actually happening
and who is saying what.

15
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.830
Ask clarifying questions

16
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.940
if in doubt or if you feel like something seems strange. 

17
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.760
Ask - it could all just be a misunderstanding.

18
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.020
Empathy and early on investing time in getting 
to know people and learning who they are.

19
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.080
No matter if it is a company or 
a colleague right next to you

20
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.230
so you actually understand 
and don't talk past each other.

21
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.770
It is very important to match your 
expectations and discuss deadlines.

22
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.190
The different project management tools

23
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.890
we use are efficient, because they help with 
a continuous internal and external match of expectations.

24
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.890


25
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.620
I think it is extremely important with this 
clarification in the group. Also to determine

26
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.340
whether we have fixed working hours.

27
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.920
If we all agree to meet at 8 AM, 
we must all be there at 8 AM

28
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.030
and you keep track on each others tasks.

29
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.570
If anyone need a helping hand 
or with keeping track.

30
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.060
Be explicit and clear about
the challenges you face.

31
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.670
This will provide greater understanding as for example

32
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.720
why you turn up late.

33
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.920
If everyone is updated on the process,
the stress caused by a stalled project

34
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.420
will most often not be so problematic.

35
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.780
Because you know that everyone prioritize 
and learn to be on the same page.

36
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.430
If I collaborate with others,
I use Trello boards.

37
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.240
I create some lists and 
the first is named "to do".

38
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.370
The next is named "in progress" and
the next is named "stumble blocks".

39
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.610
And the final one is named "done".

40
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.840
You can also make time estimates 
and deadlines.

41
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.630
So it is a great tool

42
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.240
for collaborating on a task.

43
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.810
I have tried out various 
types of communication platforms.

44
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.580
Facebook has something called Workgroup, there 
is a platform called Asana and there is Slack

45
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.120
and Trello. All of them are, 

46
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.200
if used by all team members, efficient.
If not everyone use them, then it is more efficient 

47
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.660
to just talk face to face.
