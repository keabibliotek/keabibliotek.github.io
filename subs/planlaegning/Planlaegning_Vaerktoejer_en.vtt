00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.250
I think it's very much about the overview.

2
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.660
Having an overview of the process, so you know what's next 
and it doesn't feel like a plan we once made

3
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.070
- but now it's over there, somewhere.

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.700
I think it is important 
to make it visual

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.470
and a lot of the tools we use 
are for exactly that.

6
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:33.270
A GANTT chart is a long list of 
project tasks in a sequence 

7
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.140
described in words.

8
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.590
The list is on one side and 
on the other is a timeline.

9
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.650
This timeline describes how much time 
the task takes

10
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.260
and you can use arrows to see which tasks 
are interdependent and how they connect

11
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.140
to one each other visually on the timeline.

12
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.040
It makes perfect sense to 
organise tasks in interconnections,

13
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.290
so you know which tasks you

14
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.610
can't start before other 
tasks are completed.

15
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.600
It is a good structure.

16
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.150
You note a task on a card and 
get the overview on a board.

17
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.770
It can be digital or physical with 
various cards that list tasks and

18
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.380
you move them like in a swim lane diagram.

19
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.900
You can see what to do next, 
what you are doing now and what has been done,

20
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.900


21
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.150
and typically it also contains a backlog to help you 
see if you are lacking behind and something needs prioritising.

22
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.150


23
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:32.010
The advantages of dividing tasks into the most simple, 

24
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.270
specific description

25
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.060
is that everyone understands it and 
you only work on one task at a time.

26
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.050
Scrum is a system where you basically delegate tasks and keep track

27
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.190
on each other so when you use this 
method, it is important

28
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.940
to arrange frequent meetings - one in the morning
 and one in the afternoon. It is really good

29
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.930
because it keeps everyone engaged.

30
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.110
Personally, I get less stressed 
because I can actually see the completed tasks.

31
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.110


32
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.150
Getting things done is a system where you
 collect all your tasks and projects,

33
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.290
analyse them and

34
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.610
organise them accordingly to your own system

35
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.700
before you start working.

36
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.570
It reminds me of a system we use within 
our professional field, which is called

37
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.120
LPS - last planner system.

38
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.380
You distribute your tasks across the semester, 
the entire project, the entire task

39
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.770
and divide it into phases.

40
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.400
Then, you plan week by week and
every week you plan day by day.

41
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.140
You end every week with a review meeting 
where you define, what to do on the following week.

42
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.310
And every time you enter a new phase, 
you review the entire phase before you

43
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.610
plan for the week.

44
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.920
IDEOs' development process is often divided 
into three stages: hear, create and deliver.

45
00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.380
In the H stage we focus 
on data collection.

46
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.880
- getting to know the user, research on existing solutions
 and identify the real problem.

47
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.880


48
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.660
C stands for create and is simply put about 
prototyping and testing various mock-ups.

49
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.030
It can be physical models or rapidly made 
business plans we evaluate

50
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.650
and validate with business partners.

51
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.100
In the deliver phase we mature the product 
to make it ready for hand over

52
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.150
or pass on.

53
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.680
It can be everything from certifications and 
specific tests to packaging design and

54
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.550
establishing supply chain and logistics.
