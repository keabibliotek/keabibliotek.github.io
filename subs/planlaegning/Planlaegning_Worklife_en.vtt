00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.520
My boyfriend and I have
a long workday, so I try

2
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.880
to get all of my work done before he gets home
so we have the evenings together.

3
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.440
But sometimes it is difficult because
I am self-employed and always working.

4
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.750
I am getting better to take some
days off once in a while in order

5
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.030
to have a good process.

6
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.970
Here in the startup phase the difference
between work and leisure time is a bit fuzzy.

7
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.970


8
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.200
It can be hard when you are at a
restaurant and a client calls

9
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.580
you have to pick up because it 
is money in the pocket.

10
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.370
I think it is important to
keep your priorities straight.

11
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.050
You have two lifes.

12
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.410
You have a private and a work life and 
you can afford to have a mess in one of them.

13
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.410


14
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.630
If both are messy you get stressed
and if you feel stressed

15
00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.630


16
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.810
make sure to straighten things 
out in one of them, so clean up your

17
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.330
private- or study life.

18
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.500
If work stresses me the first thing
I do is to try and find out why

19
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.390
and sort it out myself.

20
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.620
If I realise that it is caused 
by something out of my control,

21
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.620


22
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.620
then I have to ask for help and here is it 
important with a good relation with your  

23
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.450
colleagues and manager.

24
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.930
I don't feel like I stress that much in my work 
because you have the luxury to

25
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:26.560
pick and chose.

26
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.670
What you want and do not want to do.

27
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.660
I do not have my work mail on my phone

28
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.980
and I do not check it on the
computer when I am off.

29
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.020
When I am off I take time off.

30
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.980
Remember to take brakes.

31
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.640
I have been very conscious of this
in this last phase while doing my bachelors.

32
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.740
where you feel like there is nothing
more important than this last assignment

33
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.990
you have been writing for 7 days
straight full time

34
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.960
and then suddenly you have a day
where nothing happens on the blank paper

35
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.400
then it is time to do something.

36
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.140
So I took a whole day off and
told myself - no work today!

37
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.040
And then the next day I wrote 6 pages
so it really gives you some peace of mind

38
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.510
to take a day off

39
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.820
and it makes you more
effective when working.
