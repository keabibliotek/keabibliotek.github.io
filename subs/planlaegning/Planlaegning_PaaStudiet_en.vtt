00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.540
My study has prepared me for project 
planning by giving me some

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.500
basic tools

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.110
that are great for visualising.

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.870
We work a lot with these GANTT charts 
which I think gives you a good general view

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.870


6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.420
of the time schedule.

7
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.250
Group work is a part of real world worklife

8
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.810
nine out of ten times, so it's better 
to gain experiences during your studies 

9
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.550
rather that in worklife.

10
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.490
Early on in my studies, I had a strong 
focus on very concrete tasks.

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.490


12
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.660
Building or visualising something in order 
to know, if I could figure it out.

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.660


14
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.970
Through assignments, as part of our larger projects,

15
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.080
I started to understand the value of 
planning and communication.

16
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.820
And when we finally had a dedicated course 
with these topics, everything clicked.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.820
