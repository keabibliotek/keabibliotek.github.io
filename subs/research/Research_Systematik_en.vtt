00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.360
Search processes can be messy and 
extremely time consuming.

2
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.510
It can from time to time feel like 
you loose orientation and get stuck.

3
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.330
Either, you can't find anything about your topic.

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.500
Or you drown in a sea of 
irrelevant sources.

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.010
If it's difficult to find information about 
your topic, it doesn't necessarily mean that there

6
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.030
is nothing written about it.

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.980
We will present you with a systematic 
approach to information searching in order to

8
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.310
improve the likelihood that you find the good sources 
and as a tool to help you

9
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.260
if you are stuck.

10
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.050
The basic approach is to give you a visual 
overview over your topic and sub-topics.

11
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.590
One method to break down your topic is 
by creating a mind-map. At the middle

12
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.940
you note your key question.

13
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.810
Then you write all the various 
aspects or sub-topics.

14
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.760
And finally you spend a few minutes to reflect 
on which search terms you can use to

15
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.570
find something on the topic.

16
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.380
That can be abbreviations, 
synonyms, technical terms and translations.

17
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.960
There are multiple reasons to use the 
mind-map method in your research process.

18
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.820
Firstly, you actually do not know which 
words the author has used to

19
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.480
describe the topic. To take this into account, it 
is a good idea to reflect

20
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.530
upon your use of search terms.

21
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.550
Secondly, the visualisation can help you
see which paths of your search you

22
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.770
already covered, and 
which ones were dead ends.

23
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.150
And finally, the mind-map can help you focus
 and define what you choose not to include

24
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.990
in your search.

25
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.560
A good search strategy contains 
all considerations.

26
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.760
With a good search strategy, your information 
need will be more clear and your choices

27
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.000
will be more obvious, which in the long
run will save you a lot of frustrations.

28
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.000
