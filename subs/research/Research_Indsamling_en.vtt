00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.280
You can find many answers by searching 
but sometimes the information you need just isn't

2
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.870
out there. Is your information need so specific 
or local that you can't find

3
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.400
anything no matter how good the search strategy,
you have to take to the field and collect data yourself.

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.400


5
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.530
Basically, data collection falls within
two categories: qualitative and

6
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.340
quantitative. Whether you should pick one 
over the other depends on your research

7
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.630
question. Often, the two types will complement 
each other and answer different aspects of your

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.680
question. Quantitative research methods are used 
to find general characteristics about a

9
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.340
given group.

10
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.540
Questionnaires fall within this category where 
your data is essentially countable.

11
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.280
You can, as an example, use quantitative 
research methods to detect how many 

12
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.350
within a group is for or against self-driving cars in traffic. 
With qualitative methods

13
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.730
- as for example interviews -

14
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.050
you move closer to the individual to answer
questions about why or how. You can

15
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.250
in other words get a deeper understanding of the individual 
and a more nuanced view on the persons'

16
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.270
attitudes and values and why the person 
is for or against self-driving cars.

17
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.580
There are various types of qualitative research methods,
for example expert interviews,

18
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.220
semi structured interviews 
and focus groups.

19
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.240
You can use these methods for in-depth
surveys on thoughts and 

20
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.470
attitudes towards a given topic.

21
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.250
Before you initiate your data collection

22
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.120
it is important that you test your 
questions on friends or family and ask

23
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.740
how they interpret the questions.

24
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.760
This is especially important with questionnaires, 
where you can't adjust the questions on the fly

25
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.350
as you can with interviews.

26
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.590
It is therefore important that 
your questions are clearly defined.

27
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.440
And that the choices are
exhaustive and relevant.

28
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.480
At the Library you can find instructive books on research 
methods to help you with your qualitative and

29
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.800
quantitative research.
