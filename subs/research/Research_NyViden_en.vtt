00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.100
When you research for your studies, it is 
of course important to keep yourself oriented

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.800
in the study programme.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.980
And in the curriculum 
laid out by your teacher.

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.930
Still, you can easily dig into and explore 
your own specific interests within your profession.

5
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.910
In practice, that means you seek out and consult 
the newest knowledge even if it maybe

6
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:22.810
extends beyond your curriculum.

7
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.280
This sort of research can help you 
strengthen your personal professional profile.

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.690
Therefore, it is an especially good idea to start identifying

9
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.250
relevant sources, whether they report on knowledge 
from research, the industry or current trends.

10
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.260
Next, you should consider how to get the newest 
knowledge merged into your personal news flow.

11
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270


12
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.110
A good place to start is to identify 
relevant organisations, associations,

13
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.000
institutes and educational institutions.

14
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.050
Here, you'll find various offers to attend 
free of charge - for example

15
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.870
debates, conferences, online 
courses and seminars.

16
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.170
Furthermore, many associations publish members' magazines 
that can be found online.

17
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.600
If you want to dig deeper into your topic 
and is particularly interested in verified knowledge on

18
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.920
a higher academic level,

19
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.100
you should get a general view of 
relevant researchers and teachers.

20
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.220
Keep an eye out for where and
how they communicate on their research.

21
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.590
Maybe you can access the newest publications online, 
find relevant interviews or

22
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.780
maybe they participate in professional events.

23
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.310
A third place to keep yourself updated on
new knowledge of more applied science is at

24
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.840
companies and product developers.

25
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.620
Many companies produce knowledge 
in cooperation with universities.

26
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.370
And it can be a good idea to sign 
up for their news letters to keep up to date

27
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.970
on the development.

28
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.920
You can also find the newest knowledge by exploring tendencies and trends in society.

29
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.390
Consider which players who push the 
agenda and who influence

30
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.020
the development.

31
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.190
Maybe you identify key persons 
or specific groups that are worth

32
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.630
following on social media

33
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.740
or through podcasts as they 
might deal with your subject in depth.

34
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.070
They are good access points to new knowledge 
and even though they're not always on the highest

35
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.900
academic level,

36
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.720
perhaps they provide you with a reference or 
link to other sources to delve deeper into.

37
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.720


38
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.920
The point is that you don't need to actively look 
for new knowledge every week to keep updated.

39
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.210
But that you keep updated through your news flow and 
continuously get exposed to the newest knowledge within 

40
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.660
your field.
