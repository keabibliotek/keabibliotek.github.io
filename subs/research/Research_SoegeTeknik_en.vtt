00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.420
There are many ways to approach a search process.

2
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.890
Often, you will start a search using 
the first search terms that pop into your mind.

3
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.890


4
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.290
That can be fine for a quick overview

5
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.490However, search engines as Google are extra 
efficient if you use search codes when searching.

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.540
You can, for example, use filetype:pdf if 
you want to search for pdf files only.

7
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.980
Or you can use site: to search 
within a specific domain or 

8
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.820
on websites from a given country.

9
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.490
You can also search for exact sentences 
by putting search terms in quotes.

10
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.210
Be aware that you can miss a lot of relevant 
information if you only use search engines.

11
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.290
This is due to the fact that a large amount of information 
is published in databases that are not openly available

12
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.740
but restricted to a payed subscription or 
access through your educational institution.

13
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.740


14
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.590
Heading directly to the databases can actually 
be a shortcut if you know what you are looking for.

15
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.270
These are often limited in relation 
to subject coverage or knowledge type, 

16
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.130
eg. statistics or academic articles.

17
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.400
So, when you know what you need, you get 
an idea about which databases to search in.

18
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.220
Most databases contain more search 
options than you see at first sight.

19
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.870
Every database holds specific options 
which you often find under

20
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.830
advanced search.

21
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.150
Advanced search is basically about 
using and combining good search terms.

22
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.220
You can often use the words “and”, 
“or”, “not” to specify your search.

23
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.330
You can use the three words to 
narrow down or widen your search.

24
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.620
For example, if you put “and” between two 
search terms, you will only get results

25
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.530
which contain both.

26
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.380
But the term self-driving has various synonyms, 
among other things autonomous, driver-less

27
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.950
and robot-driven and since you don’t 
know which term the author has chosen

28
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.320
it can be a good idea to search 
for them all in a single search.

29
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.210
You can do this by using “or” which widens 
your search to contain all the relevant synonyms.

30
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.860
This way, you widen your search and 
you can of course translate everything 

31
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.780
to English or other languages for even more results.
Narrow down your search 

32
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.010
by using fewer search terms and ”not”.

33
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.070
If you get too many results related 
with Uber’s cars, use “not”

34
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.270
to exclude results containing the word Uber.
