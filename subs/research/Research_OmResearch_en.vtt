00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.780
It is an essential skill to be able to 
search and evaluate good, valid information not only 

2
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.180
during your studies, but to a great extent 
also when you enter the labour market.

3
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.900
We search on a daily basis for everything from the weather forecast, new shoes 
or travel without any special skill requirements.

4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.460
But when it comes to information seeking 
in relation to assignments there are

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.260
special requirements to your sources - and thus your search. 
Simply put, you can 

6
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.060
arrange most sources within three levels.

7
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.380
These levels

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.010
can be used to quickly evaluate a sources' 
professional weight when you search for information.

9
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.200
On the academic level, you find academic 
articles and research findings.

10
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.150
On the professional level, you find trade journals, 
textbooks and industry reports and  

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.610
on the popular level, you find magazines, newspapers, blogs, etc.

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.370
Not all sources can be placed within the hierarchy.

13
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.540
For example, you can basically trust 
the quality and validity of legislation

14
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.200
and standards.

15
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.360
The higher in the hierarchy your source 
is placed, the more scientific it is

16
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.580
- in part because the authors are professional experts, 
but also simply because the publication requirements are more strict

17
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.810
in terms of accuracy, research methods and sources.

18
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.880
It is totally fine to use sources from 
the professional level in your assignments,

19
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.450
but in some cases, it can be a good idea 
to find sources from a higher level.

20
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.900
Be careful when using sources from the popular level and

21
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.230
never use them to back up essential arguments.

22
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.160
If you for example write about potential consequences 
on the labour market caused by self-driving cars 

23
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.780
it makes a difference whether you 
use an article from Politiken or

24
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.640
a report from a labour research project at RUC.

25
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.970
Ultimately, your sources back up your argumentation

26
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.690
and brilliant sources on the academic or professional 
level puts you in a stronger position.
