When deciding whether to use a source or not the first step
is always to consider what type of source you have in front of you.

2
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.460


3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.940
Is it a non-fiction textbook?
A newspaper? A product catalogue?

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.870
Or a commercial webpage?

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.980
Sources come in many shapes
and different source types are suitable

6
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.740
for different purposes.

7
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.790
One, to find the price of a cool t-shirt.

8
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.940
Another, to find information on
analysis models and statistics.

9
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.820
Then, you need to further explore
the background data of the source

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.700
to help decide if the information in
the source is valid.

11
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.990
Does it come from a journalist?
A company? A professional?

12
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.660
Or a retired high school teacher
from Vejle?

13
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.650
For that purpose, it might be a good idea to search for some
background information on the source.

14
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.020
Yes, a simple Google search might do the trick.
