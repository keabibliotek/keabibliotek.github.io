00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.940
When working with sources
it is imperative to know the age of the source.

2
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.090
Therefore, it is important to investigate

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.210
whether the source you are using is
current enough for your purpose

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.990
Is the knowledge you need from
the source still up-to-date

5
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.280
or does more suitable
knowledge exist?

6
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.150
If you are for instance researching
something about sustainable companies

7
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.010
this article from the
American magazine Forbes

8
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.470
has a lot of interesting angles
and pieces of information.

9
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.790
But remember to check the date!

10
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.530
The article is from 2010 and because
the development is very fast within the field

11
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.780
it is crucial that you use
the most recent sources.

12
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.100
Some areas, like for instance sustainability or
social media are in constant development

13
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.100


14
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.860
therefore articles within these
fields are quickly outdated.

15
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.010
Other areas are less variable 

16
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.370
therefore a source can be up-to-date
although it is not brand new.

17
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.600
For instance some standards within the
building industry are still up-to-date

18
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.320
even though they are several years old.

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.690
There is also a lot of scientific research 
that is still current, although it is 

20
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.480
not from recent years.

21
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.070
In most cases, it is important that you use
the most current knowledge within your field.

22
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.510
But being up-to-date does not only refer
to the source being brand new 

23
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.560
but also that it is the right source for your project!
