00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.720
There can be many different
intentions behind a source.

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.470
Therefore, it is important to keep a critical mindset
in order to better decode the motive of the source.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.600
Start by asking yourself
why the source is written

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.930
who it is written for
and what the purpose of the source is?

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.100
Is the source written with the purpose of informing
or does it try to sell something

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.100


7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.980
like a politicial agenda
or a commercial product?

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.300
If you are searching for information
about solar panels for instance

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.970
this homepage could be quite useful.

10
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.020
But at the same time it is obvious
that the main purpose is to sell a product!


11
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.030
Regardless whether the information
is sound or not 

12
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.710
it can be problematic to use sources
that have clear commercial interests. 

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.710

14
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.160
Instead it can be a good idea
to get information about the solar panels

15
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.810
From an official source like the Danish Energy Agency
who works independently from commercial and political interests.

16
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.810
