It can be difficult to determine whether the
arguments in a source are transparent.

2
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.020
Therefore, it is always a good idea
to dig deeper when working with a source.

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.880
Here are three tricks that
can help you do just that.

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.880
Check the source references.
Does the information come from a survey, 

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.950
or does it represent the author's
own stance on the subject?

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.870
Consider the argumentation in the source.

7
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.880
Is there a common thread and clear
connection between them? 

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.280
Are the arguments one-sided 
or do they encompass several aspects?

9
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.920
Consider the language of the source.
Does the source try to convince you through logical

10
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.270
or emotional arguments?
Is the source full of spelling errors or grammatical errors?

11
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.160
Have fun with the sources!
