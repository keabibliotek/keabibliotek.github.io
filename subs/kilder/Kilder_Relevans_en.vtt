00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.290
Seen in isolation
there is no such thing as a bad source.

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.060
But whether a source is relevant for your project
depends on what you plan to use it for.

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.060


4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.490
Relevance is basically about the context
you want to use the source in.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.870
Let's for instance say that you are trying
to find something about people's Facebook habits.


6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.870

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.710
After a quick Google search
you may run into this article.

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.660
Although the article is from
"Women's Magazine" 

9
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.790
it is not necessarily a bad source

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.090
but if you need a source about the general population's
Facebook habits in your project

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.150
it would probably be best
to find a more weighty source.

12
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.130
Maybe something written by a professional within the field.

13
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.560
In cases like this, it would be best to use
a source from an academic or a professional

14
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.870
as their credentials increase
the credibility of the source.


15
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.590
In the article from "Women's Magazine"


16
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.230
the journalist actually refers to a
reputable researcher within the field.

17
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.460
Here, it would be a good idea
to dive into the sources that the journalist uses

18
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.330
in this case the researcher.

19
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.650
The researcher has more professional credibility
because she is the one who initially

20
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.090
made the research about Facebook habits.

21
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.350
To sum up, relevance is about evaluating
which sources are most useful

22
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.420
in the context of a specific subject.
