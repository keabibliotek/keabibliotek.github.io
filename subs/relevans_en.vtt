WEBVTT - Kildekritik relevans

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Seen in isolation, there is no such thing as a bad source -

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
- but whether a source is relevant for your project, depends on what you plan to use it for.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Relevance is basically about the context you want to use the source in -

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Let's for instance say, that you are trying to find something about people's Facebook habits.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
After a quick Google search, you may run into this article.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Although the article is from "Women's Magazine", it is not necessarily a bad source -

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
- but if you need a source about the general population's Facebook habits in your project - 

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
- it would probably be best to find a more weighty source - maybe something written by a professional within the field.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
In cases like this, it would be best to use a source from an academic or a professional, as their credentials increase the credibility of the source.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
In the article from "Women's Magazine" the journalist actually refers to a reputable researcher within the field.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Here, it would be a good idea to dive into the sources that the journalist uses - in this case the researcher.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
The researcher has more professional credibility, because she is the one who initially made the research about Facebook habits.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
To sum up, relevance is about evaluating which sources are most useful in the context of a specific subject.
