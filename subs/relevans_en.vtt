When deciding whether to use a source or not, the first step is always to -

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
- consider which type of source you have in front of you.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Is it a non-fiction textbook? A newspaper? A product catalogue?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Or a commercial webpage?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Sources can come in many shapes.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
And different source types are suitable for different purposes.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
One, to find the price of a cool t-shirt -

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
- another, to find information on analysis models and statistics.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Then, you need to further explore the background data of the source - 

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
to help decide if the source is a valid one.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Does it come from a journalist? A company? A professional?

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Or a retired high school teacher from Vejle?

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
For that purpose, it might be a good idea to search for some background information on the source.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Yes, a simple Google search might do the trick.
