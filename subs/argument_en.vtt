WEBVTT - Kildekritik intro

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
Hi, my name is Frederick.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
And I am Jonas.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Welcome to this guide about source criticism.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
As a student you will encounter many different sources, that require you to consider how they can be used.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
The purpose of these videos is to help improve your understanding of how to find the best sources during your studies.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
A good understanding of source criticism is not only something you can use as a student -

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
- but can also come in very handy in your everyday life.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
It is important to be able to distinguish between good and bad sources -

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
- especially when you have been tasked with a job from an employer, or you have to navigate the social media.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
Here, we will present you with five short concepts that are important when validating sources.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
The five concepts are connected and supplement each other, but are of course only meant as a guideline.
