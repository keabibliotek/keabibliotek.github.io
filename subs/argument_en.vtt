WEBVTT - Kildekritik argument

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
It can be difficult to determine whether the arguments in a source are transparent.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Therefore, it is always a good idea to dig deeper when working with a source.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Here are three tricks than can help you do just that.

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
Check the source references. Does the information come from a survey, or does it represent the author's own stance on the subject?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Consider the argumentation in the source. Is there a common thread and clear connection between them? 

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Are the arguments one-sided or do they encompass several aspects?

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
Consider the language of the source. Does the source try to convince you through logical or emotional arguments?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Is the source full of spelling errors or grammatical errors?

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Have fun with the sources!
